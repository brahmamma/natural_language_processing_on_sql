NLP Based SQL QueryRetrieval System
The goal of NLP is to enable communication between people and computers without resorting to memorization of complex commands and procedures.
While natural language may be the easiest system for people to learn and use, it has proved to be the hardest for a computer to understand. 
In this project,with the help of nlp we designed a system which helps to communicate with the database using Natural Language.
Asking questions to the database in natural language and getting output in natural language is a easy way of accessing database without complex queries.
It helps the non technical users to interact with the databases.
This system using Natural Language Processing for converting the natural language statement to SQL query further to access data from the database
Here user can directly enter his query in natural language and our software system will internally converts that question or query into SQL query and again access the database with that query , result will be displayed to the user.
